# Distributionally Robust CVaR Filter

This repository contains an implementation of a Distributionally Robust Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) filter using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

## Features
- Calculate CVaR for each Gaussian component of the GMM.
- Compute the infimum of CVaR values.
- Check if the infimum CVaR is within a specified boundary.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
